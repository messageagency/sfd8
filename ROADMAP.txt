Basics completed so far:
- module basics - permissions, @TODOs, routes, etc.
- mapping interface
- REST client and OAuth
- push


Minimum viable product targets:
- port "salesforce_pull"
- error handling
- forward-port bug fixes and updates from D7
- purge D7 code
- migration paths from D7
- docs
- #fieldMappingField : convert SalesforceMapping::field_mappings property to some kind of entity collection. Promote mapped fields from dumb arrays to entities.


Additional major goals:
- tests, including mock testing services
- use SOAP for things that make sense
- polling and queueing
- proper support for multiple mappings per entity / entity type


Additional details:
- replace strings with consistent, drupal-wide text
  e.g. "-- Select --", "--" . t('Select') . "--", "Select Object Type", etc.
  Nobody wants to translate all those.
  
- Replace hooks with interfaces, plugins, event subscribers, etc.

- Automatically pre-add all required Salesforce fields to mappings
  - require that they be mapped
  - require a key radio button be ticked

- Salesforce Push / Salesforce Mapping Object should be turned into a mock fields
  similar to drupal core Path
  - free CRUD operations. get rid of hook_entity_* operations
  - better separation of logic
  - easier for other modules to extend, alter behavior
  - standardized, consolidated approach

- Since Drupal Queue Interface is a properly OOP now, we should create a 
Salesforce Queue implementation that unlocks the full potential of Salesforce API
Whether or not this is dependent on SOAP is somewhat irrelevant, as REST and SOAP
could use the same queue interface, regardless of whether REST can leverage 
the advanced features of SOAP.

- Conversions to do when https://drupal.org/node/1972304 lands

- Migration paths for field mappings
  -- wait for dust to settle on field mapping schema
  
- Migration paths for mapping object
  -- wait for dust to settle on mapping object schema
